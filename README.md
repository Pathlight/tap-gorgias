# tap-gorgias

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted data
following the [Singer
spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

This tap:

- Pulls raw data from [Gorigas](https://developers.gorgias.com/reference)
- Extracts the following resources:
  - [Tickets](https://developers.gorgias.com/reference#get_api-tickets)
    - Note that in order to pull tickets in descending order (as this tap requires) a new View object will need to be created. This is best done through the API with the following request:
    ```
    from tap_gorgias import GorgiasAPI

    client = GorgiasAPI(config) 
    url = "https://4patriots.gorgias.com/api/views"

    payload = {
        "category": "ticket-list",
        "order_by": "updated_datetime",
        "order_dir": "desc",
        "shared_with_users": [<your admin user id>],
        "type": "ticket-list",
        "visibility": "private",
        "slug": "pathlight-tickets"
    }

    resp = client.get(url, params=payload)
    id = resp['id']
    ```
    Then add this ID to the config as `tickets_view_id` and you're all set!

  - TBD: [Satisfaction Ratings]()
- Outputs the schema for each resource
- Incrementally pulls data based on the input state
